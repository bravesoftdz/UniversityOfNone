# UniversityOfNone
Computing science articles from University of None (not affiliated with any University).

It's time to convert some of my computing science articles from old wikis, websites, and mailing list posts over to simple articles that anyone can read that will not be just stored on personal websites, wikis, etc., but on a github central location. As this is github, the articles indeed will contain source code embedded in them as part of the article.  Some articles may not contain source code but descriptions of source code models to implement. Most will contain source code and√©or math.

Formats of computing science articles: plain text, PDF, html.

As this is a work in progress, it will take time for me to scour through hundreds of articles and publish them here.

# Copyright of Articles
A simple Open Copyright. You may modify, extend, or copy this article provided that you note you are not the original author but note you extended it and add your name to the copyright.

# To do
Make some program to automate this. Convert wiki and website articles to pdf/txt/static html files.

Possibly also make a science university of none project (not computing science but physics, biology, evolution, etc.)

# Rant:
Interesting GPL/BSD question: why should I release any of this, without payment? Normally people write a book, or charge for courses... if source code is free, why is education costing $20,000 per year, or five years, or whatever it costs? This will have to be considered. Education can be easily copied/replicated, so why is it different than software? I really don't know why.

Interesting projects similar to this:
* MIT Open Courseware (thanks Walter Lewin)
* Creative Commons
* GNU FDL (free documentation license). But unfortunately it's a cult like and a rambly/verbose nonsensical license
* hardware documentation. Thanks for all companies documenting (and educating people about) their hardware
