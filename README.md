# UniversityOfNone
Computing science articles from University of None (not affiliated with any University).

It's time to convert some of my computing science articles from old wikis, websites, and mailing list posts over to simple articles that anyone can read that will not be just stored on personal websites, wikis, etc., but on a github central location.

Formats of computing science articles: plain text, PDF, html.

As this is a work in progress, it will take time for me to scour through hundreds of articles and publish them here.

# To do
Make some program to automate this. Convert wiki and website articles to pdf/txt/static html files.

Possibly also make a science university of none project (not computing science but physics, biology, evolution, etc.)
